## ENDC FLM Container view

The rApp is organized in two blocks, a frontend (owl based) and a backend.
Please refer to the following diagrams for details on the different blocks.
OWL employs a three tiered architecture with a frontend responsible for rendering output,
a backend responsible for REST calls to the application backend and a REDIS instance used as persistent cache.
It is currently deployed a single pod. The component view of OWL is out of scope of this documentation.
